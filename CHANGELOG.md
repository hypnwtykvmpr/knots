# kno

## 0.15.11

### Patch Changes

- bd5a3eb: Publish GitHub Release notes from the Changesets-built `CHANGELOG.md` entry for
  the shipped version. The release workflow now uses that changelog section as
  the release body, so releases show the actual user-facing changes instead of
  only the `Version Packages` PR merge.
- 2b46132: Fix `kno sync push` for projects that use a configured Knots store root, so
  local event files are found and published from the active store instead of only
  from `.knots/` under the repository root.

  Clarify sync push progress output so a no-op push reports that local files are
  being checked, and only reports copied files when files actually need to be
  copied into the publish worktree.

## 0.15.10

### Patch Changes

- dc11466: Fix managed skills gitignore rules so `.agents` and `.claude` are recursively
  ignored except for their `skills` directories. `kno doctor --fix` now also
  repairs legacy managed-skills gitignore rules when skills are already installed.

## 0.15.9

### Patch Changes

- 7a4e510: Fix gitignore setup for Knots-managed project directories. `kno init` now
  ensures `.knots` is ignored, while `kno skills install` ignores `.agents` and
  `.claude` contents except for their allowlisted `skills` directories.

## 0.15.8

### Patch Changes

- 8af7518: Tag, query, profile, and `--all` filters now apply before pagination on
  `kno ls --json`. Previously, only `--state` and `--type` were pushed into
  SQL, while tag/query filters ran after `LIMIT`/`OFFSET` was applied. As a
  result, `kno ls --tag <tag> --json --limit 1` could return an empty data
  array even when matches existed, and `total` reported the unfiltered hot
  count instead of the filtered match count. The paginated path now
  materializes the full hot tier, applies the same filter pipeline as the
  non-paginated path, sets `total` to the filtered count, and slices the
  filtered list by `offset`/`limit`. Pages are stable across offsets and
  `has_more` is consistent with `total` and `data.length`.
- becf694: `kno ls --json` now reports consistent pagination metadata for text queries
  that filter out every row on the requested page. Previously, the SQL layer
  paginated before the in-memory query filter ran, so a query with no matches
  could return `data: []` alongside `total: 50` and `has_more: true`. The CLI
  now applies all filters before paginating, so empty matches report
  `total: 0` and `has_more: false`.

## 0.15.7

### Patch Changes

- d59ca7d: Knots commands invoked from a Git linked worktree now share the canonical
  repo `.knots` store with the primary worktree. Previously the post-merge
  sync hook tried to check out the `knots` branch into a per-worktree
  `.knots/_worktree` and failed with `fatal: 'knots' is already used by
worktree at '<primary>/.knots/_worktree'`. The store path is now resolved
  via `git rev-parse --git-common-dir` so all linked worktrees of the same
  repo see one Knots store.

## 0.15.6

### Patch Changes

- ce81baa: `kno doctor` no longer warns forever about `cold_tier_imbalance`. The check
  now measures three real tier invariants — disjointness (no id in both hot and
  cold), cold-is-terminal-only, and no stale-terminal hot rows — instead of
  treating "fewer than 100 hot knots and a non-empty cold catalog" as a problem.
  A repo whose cold tier holds only legitimately-old shipped/abandoned knots is
  healthy. `kno doctor --fix` restores each invariant idempotently and the next
  sync, sweep, and snapshot bootstrap all uphold them, so doctor stays `pass`.
  See `docs/tier-balance.md`.
- de08eac: Fix `kno sync` dropping descriptions for knots created with `kno new -d`. Create
  now emits a separate `knot.description_set` event so the standard apply path
  populates description on the receiving host. The sync-apply and rehydrate paths
  also gained a backward-compat read of the inline `body` field on `knot.created`
  events so descriptions on knots created before this fix are recovered on the
  next pull. The compat reads will be removed once the pre-fix event cohort ages
  out (tracked by knot `83b1`).

## 0.15.5

### Patch Changes

- 564671a: Execution plan knots now require an objective at creation and on update. `kno
new` and `kno update` reject execution-plan knots that lack an objective, and
  the execution-plan docs describe the field. Existing non-execution-plan knots
  are unaffected.
- 564671a: Gate evaluation prompts now carry the knot's acceptance criteria, so the
  evaluator sees the same contract the author wrote. Prompt resolution threads
  acceptance through `gate_sdlc/prompts/evaluating.md` and the knots prompt
  pipeline; no flag changes, but evaluations gain context automatically on the
  next claim.
- 564671a: Agent identity is now stamped from the bound lease across every write sink
  (next, rollback, claim, poll-claim, gate evaluate, step annotate, state, note,
  handoff). The per-command `--agent-name`, `--agent-model`, `--agent-version`,
  `--note-agent-*`, and `--handoff-agent-*` flags are still accepted for
  compatibility but are runtime-ignored and emit a deprecation warning on stderr;
  their help text is prefixed `[DEPRECATED — IGNORED]`. The deprecation warning
  uses singular or plural wording depending on how many flags were supplied. `kno
lease create` is unchanged — the lease remains the single declared source of
  agent identity.

## 0.15.4

### Patch Changes

- f035fc3: `kno doctor --fix` now emits per-operation progress lines so long-running
  repairs no longer look like a silent hang. The command announces the
  diagnostic phase, prints a `Fixing <check>...` line as each fix starts, and
  prints a `N issue(s) fixed.` summary on completion. Running `kno doctor`
  without `--fix` and `kno doctor --fix --json` are unchanged.

## 0.15.3

### Patch Changes

- 9861dcd: Fix `kno doctor --fix` leaving `workflow_id_parity` (and other event-log
  repairs) perpetually warning after a fix run. Repair events are emitted
  into the local `.knots/index/` store, but the check scans the shared
  `_worktree`, so the post-fix recheck never saw them. `apply_fixes` now
  reports whether the event log was touched, and `run_doctor_with_fix_at`
  publishes the repair events via a best-effort sync before the recheck.
  Also prevents each subsequent `kno doctor --fix` from stacking duplicate
  repair events for the same stale knots while waiting for a sync.
- 33cbe7d: Fix `kno ls --type <type>` silently missing knots first materialized by
  a `kno sync` pull. The sync-apply path never read `type` from
  `idx.knot_head` event data when upserting a new cache row, so every
  knot authored on another machine landed in the local `knot_hot` table
  with `knot_type` NULL or empty — `kno ls --type execution_plan` (for
  example) filtered them out.

  Two changes:

  - `build_index_upsert` now reads `data.type` from the index event and
    falls back to the existing cached value only when the event omits
    it. Future pulls populate `knot_type` correctly on first apply.
  - New `knot_type_backfill` doctor check + `--fix` path backfills
    already-corrupted caches by scanning the worktree's latest
    `idx.knot_head` event per affected knot and writing the type back to
    `knot_hot`. No event emission — purely a local cache repair.

- ff4e566: Fix `kno rehydrate` and `kno doctor --fix`'s cold-tier sweep silently
  failing for knots pulled from origin. `rehydrate_from_events` only
  scanned the local `.knots/events/` and `.knots/index/` directories, but
  events arriving via `kno sync` pull land in `.knots/_worktree/.knots/`
  and are never copied into the local store. Rehydrating such a knot
  failed with `missing workflow_id`, and `fix_cold_tier_imbalance`
  swallowed the per-knot error — so the doctor warning persisted with
  zero rehydrations even when there were plenty of cold candidates.

  `rehydrate_from_events` now accepts multiple store roots and callers
  pass both the local and worktree roots, deduped by relative filename
  so locally-mirrored events aren't replayed twice.

- b61cd69: Fix `kno sync` hard-failing on legacy events that predate the
  2026-04-09 strictness change ("Remove legacy workflow runtime
  fallbacks"). Two tolerant fallbacks are restored at apply time so a
  bootstrap pull of a pre-cutoff repo no longer errors out with
  `missing 'profile_id' string field`:

  - `required_profile_id` defaults to `"autopilot"` when the field is
    missing or empty, instead of erroring. Silent; the event log stays
    intact and the cache row carries the modern default.
  - `required_workflow_id` now recognizes the pre-registry name
    `"default"` as a legacy value alongside `"compatibility"` and
    `"knots_sdlc"`, translating it to `"work_sdlc"` at apply time with
    the same one-time warning pattern.

  Event files on disk are not rewritten — this is read-time translation,
  consistent with the existing legacy-value handling.

## 0.15.2

### Patch Changes

- fb9e855: Deprecate `--agent-name`, `--agent-model`, and `--agent-version` on `kno claim`.
  The flags still work and continue to stamp metadata on the auto-created lease,
  but the canonical pattern is now `kno lease create` followed by `kno claim
--lease <id>`. Using the deprecated flags emits a warning to stderr and they
  will be removed in a future release.
- 65c23c0: Add a `workflow_id_parity` doctor check and `--fix` path. The check scans the
  pulled worktree for knots whose latest `idx.knot_head` event lacks
  `workflow_id`. `kno doctor --fix` publishes a minimal repair event per stale
  knot so the shared event log eventually reaches parity with modern events —
  active knots use the local DB state, archived knots use the cold catalog plus
  the workflow inferred from the stale event's knot type.
- 65c23c0: Fix `kno sync` failing on legacy `idx.knot_head` events written before
  `workflow_id` became a required field. When `workflow_id` is missing, sync now
  infers it from the event's knot type (defaulting to `work_sdlc` for `work`
  knots), matching the existing `parse_knot_type` fallback convention. A
  one-shot warning reports the inference.

## 0.9.0

### Minor Changes

- dd44d2b: Add first-class knot acceptance criteria with native storage, sync, and CLI support.
- f54ca96: Defer `kno sync` when active leases exist instead of erroring. The sync is queued via sync_pending and automatically triggered when the last active lease is terminated.

  past the state of any child knot. Attempts return an error with
  the list of blocking descendants.
- 514e786: Add `kno loom compat-test` with a Loom workflow compatibility harness, bundle failure-path
  runtime support, and JSON bundle metadata preservation for named prompt outcomes.
- f53ea7c: Add Lease knot type for agent session tracking with `--lease` flag, note
  auto-stamp, and `--json` output. Add Gate knot type with evaluation flow,
  failure reopen, and generalized rollback evaluation states. Add `kno rollback`
  and `kno rb` commands for action states. Add colored sync progress feedback.

  deferred knots to move directly into terminal states during approved
  hierarchy cascades.
- b6b3174: Add a CLI regression test covering managed-skill doctor checks and `kno doctor --fix`.
- 10d7281: Fix upgraded installs that still have legacy `{}` lease cache payloads so
  commands like `show --json` continue to work after the lease metadata schema
  expands.
- 71e5e12: Make `kno loom compat-test` self-contained by embedding the knots_sdlc loom template and
  removing the source path argument. Fix JSON bundle param deserialization for loom 0.2.0.
- 5e02e81: Improve `kno loom compat-test` text feedback and directory-aware diagnostics.
- 90762f4: Fix managed skill installation so `kno skills` deploys the `knots` and
  `knots-e2e` skills with exact path reporting and doctor guidance.
- 009f6cf: Improve parent-knot prompts and managed skill guidance so agents handle child
  knots before advancing or rolling back the parent.
- a3eb406: Pin the Rust toolchain used by CI and local sanity checks so pre-push formatting runs are deterministic.
- fe4b069: Resolve the default cache database path relative to `--repo-root` so
  `kno -C <repo> show <id>` works from outside the target repository.
- 069ce46: Allow parent to move to a terminal state without cascade approval when
  all descendants are already in the target state.

## 0.7.6

### Patch Changes

- 3ae6571: Tighten agent skill prompts so each workflow step has a clear
  single-step boundary, explicit stop condition, and fewer
  cross-stage instructions.

## 0.7.5

### Patch Changes

- Improve clone bootstrap and release version syncing

  - Make `kno init` detect an existing `origin/knots` branch, pull knots from the
    remote into a fresh clone, and continue installing managed hooks
  - Refresh and verify `Cargo.lock` during release version sync so version bumps do
    not leave the lockfile dirty for the next Cargo command

## 0.7.4

### Patch Changes

- d94a6af: Improve show/claim output and fix edge cases

  - Display the latest note and handoff capsule in `show` and `claim` output,
    with a hint to use `-v`/`--verbose` to see all entries
  - Guard `claim`/`peek` on queue state instead of relying on happy-path traversal
  - Tighten metadata hints in `show` and `claim`
  - Detect user's actual shell when `$SHELL` is unset
  - Refine implementation review guidance

## 0.7.3

### Patch Changes

    (`--add-invariant`, `--remove-invariant`, `--clear-invariants`), UI display,
    and prompt rendering.

  ### Fixes

  - Relax self_manage test assertion for coverage tool compatibility.
  - Fix `--handoff-date` to `--handoff-datetime` in skill templates.

  ### Docs

  - Add handoff capsules with full agent metadata to all skill prompt paths
    (success and failure modes).

  outdated hook content and leftover legacy hooks (e.g. post-commit). doctor --fix
  removes legacy hooks before reinstalling current managed hooks.

## 0.6.1

### Patch Changes

- 6558089: ### Fixes

  - Remove `post-commit` from managed hooks to prevent recursive fork bomb
    where each sync commit spawned another background `kno sync`.
  - Change hook template from backgrounded `kno sync` to foreground `kno pull`
    so errors are visible.
  - Add `--no-verify` to internal sync commits to prevent hook recursion while
    locks are held.

## 0.6.0

### Minor Changes

- a769b11: ### Features

  - Add `--expected-state` optimistic guard to `kno next`, making state
    progressions idempotent and preventing stale updates from clobbering
    concurrent changes.
  - Add git hooks (post-commit, post-merge, post-checkout) for automatic
    knot sync on git operations.
  - Add `doctor --fix` remediation flow that can automatically resolve
    detected issues such as version mismatches.
  - Add `commit:<hash>` tagging instructions to skill prompts and enforce
    commit tag validation in shipment review.

  ### Fixes

  - Fix `doctor --fix` version remediation to run correctly in-process.

  ### Chores

  - Polish doctor and upgrade output formatting.
  - Stabilize sync and hooks test coverage paths.
  - Additional test coverage for doctor fix, upgrade summary, and color
    fallback.

## 0.5.0

### Minor Changes

- a1eb0d4: Add structured JSON output and agent metadata to kno next

  - `kno next` now supports `--json` to emit structured JSON containing
    the knot id, previous state, new state, and owner_kind.
  - All `kno next` calls in skill prompts include agent metadata flags
    (`--actor-kind`, `--agent-name`, `--agent-model`, `--agent-version`).
  - Agent metadata is included in claim completion commands.
  - Eliminated unsafe env var manipulation from all tests in favor of
    injectable overrides.
  - Fixed sync test time drift by widening hot_window_days.

## 0.4.0

  matches the latest published release.

## 0.3.0

### Minor Changes

- 6ea8d04: Add `--peek` flag to `kno claim` that shows the claim output without advancing knot state.

## 0.2.2

### Patch Changes

- 0ae389c: Switch poll and claim completion guidance to `kno next --actor-kind agent` and add
  `--actor-kind`, `--agent-name`, `--agent-model`, and `--agent-version` to `kno next`.

## 0.2.1

### Patch Changes

- f633514: Fix `kno sync` failing when a pre-push hook is installed by adding `--no-verify` to the internal knots branch push.
- b534ff2: Refinement of skills to eliminate hardcoding local project bias.

## 0.2.0

- f3273c7: Add M2.7 field parity and migration readiness with:

  - `kno update` patch command for title, description, priority, status, type, tags,
    notes, and handoff capsules.
  - first-class `notes[]` and `handoff_capsules[]` metadata arrays
    (`username/datetime/agentname/model/version`).
  - SQLite migration v3 parity fields and backfill from legacy body/notes.
  - import and sync reducers updated for parity mapping and metadata event handling.

- 1a10eba: Add public repo readiness, release automation, and curl installer
