# Implementation

## Input
- Knot in `ready_for_implementation` state
- Approved implementation plan (in knot notes)

## Invariant Adherence
- If the knot has invariants, strictly adhere to every invariant condition
  throughout implementation.
- Scope invariants limit what code, modules, or systems may be touched.
- State invariants define properties that must remain true at all times.
- If an implementation step would violate an invariant, stop and redesign
  the approach rather than proceeding.

## Step Boundary
- This session is authorized only for `implementation`.
- Complete exactly one implementation action, then stop.
- Allowed resting states after this session:
  `ready_for_implementation_review`, `blocked`, or `ready_for_planning`.
- Do not merge the feature branch to main, perform shipment work, or
  continue into later workflow stages in this session.
- Opening or updating a review artifact for the implementation branch is
  allowed only if the profile explicitly requires it.
- After the implementation handoff and transition commands succeed, stop
  immediately.

## Actions
1. Create a feature branch from main in a worktree
2. Implement changes following the plan while respecting all invariants
3. Write tests for all new behavior
4. Run any sanity gates defined in the project or the plan
5. Commit and push the feature branch
6. Create the review artifact required by the profile output mode:
   `{{ output }}` = `remote_main` means push the feature branch to
   remote. The branch itself is the review artifact.
   `{{ output }}` = `pr` means open a pull request from the feature
   branch. The PR is the review artifact.
7. Tag the knot with each commit hash using the `commit:` prefix:
   PowerShell: `$short_hash = git rev-parse --short=12 <commit>`
   Bash: `short_hash=$(git rev-parse --short=12 <commit>)`
   `kno update <id> --add-tag "commit:${short_hash}"`
   Run this for every commit created during implementation.
   Use short hashes only; do not use the full 40-character hash.
8. Tag the knot with the artifact identifier so reviewers can find it:
   `{{ output }}` = `remote_main` means tag the branch name:
   `kno update <id> --add-tag "branch:<branch-name>"`
   `{{ output }}` = `pr` means tag the PR number:
   `kno update <id> --add-tag "pr:<number>"`
9. Add a handoff capsule that includes the artifact identifier:
   `kno update <id> --add-handoff-capsule "<summary>. Branch: <name>"`
   or for PR workflows:
   `kno update <id> --add-handoff-capsule "<summary>. PR #<number>"`

## Output
- Working implementation on feature branch
- All tests passing with coverage threshold met
- Transition:
  `kno next <id> <currentState> --lease <LEASE_ID>`

## Failure Modes
- Blocked by dependency:
  `kno update <id> --status blocked --add-note "<blocker details>"`
  `kno update <id> --add-handoff-capsule "<blocking dependency details>"`
- Implementation infeasible:
  `kno update <id> --status ready_for_planning`
  `--add-note "<blocker details>"`
  `kno update <id> --add-handoff-capsule "<reason infeasible>"`
