# Shipment Review

## Input
- Knot in `ready_for_shipment_review` state
- Code merged to main, CI green

## Write Constraints
- Review work is read-only for repository code and git state.
- Do not edit code, tests, docs, configs, or other repository files.
- Do not run git write operations (`git add`, `git commit`, `git merge`,
  `git rebase`, `git push`, `git checkout -b`, etc.).
- Allowed writes are knot metadata updates only (`kno update`
  notes/handoff_capsules/tags).
- If code/git writes are needed to complete review, stop and use the
  reject/failure path to move the knot back to a prior queue state.

## Invariant Review
- If the knot has invariants, verify the shipped code does not violate
  any of them.
- For each scope invariant, confirm only allowed areas were changed.
- For each state invariant, confirm the property still holds on main.
- Reject if any invariant condition is breached.

## Step Boundary
- This session is authorized only for `shipment_review`.
- Complete exactly one review action, then stop.
- Allowed resting states after this session: `shipped`,
  `ready_for_shipment`, or `ready_for_implementation`.
- Do not fix code, re-run shipment, or continue into other workflow
  stages in this session.
- After the review decision, handoff, and transition commands succeed,
  stop immediately.

## Actions
1. Verify the shipped result at the correct review target for the
   profile output mode:
   `{{ output }}` = `remote_main` means review the code now on main.
   `{{ output }}` = `pr` means review the merged pull request as the
   shipment record and confirm the corresponding code is now on main.
2. Confirm every commit from implementation/shipment is tagged on the
   knot:
   - Use the `commit:` prefix for each tag.
   - Each tag must include a short hash from
     `git rev-parse --short=12 <commit>` (not the full 40-character hash).
3. Verify all knot invariants hold in the shipped code
4. Confirm CI/CD pipeline completed successfully
5. Validate no regressions in dependent systems
6. Final sign-off

## Output
- Approved:
  `kno update <id> --add-handoff-capsule "<review summary>"`
  `kno next <id> <currentState> --lease <LEASE_ID>`
- Needs revision:
  `kno update <id> --status ready_for_implementation`
  `--add-note "<blocker details>"`
  `kno update <id> --add-handoff-capsule "<revision needed>"`
- Critical regression:
  `kno update <id> --status ready_for_implementation`
  `--add-note "<blocker details>"`
  `kno update <id> --add-handoff-capsule "<critical regression>"`

## Failure Modes
- Deployment issue:
  `kno update <id> --status ready_for_shipment`
  `--add-note "<blocker details>"`
  `kno update <id> --add-handoff-capsule "<deployment issue>"`
- Regression detected:
  `kno update <id> --status ready_for_implementation`
  `--add-note "<blocker details>"`
  `kno update <id> --add-handoff-capsule "<regression details>"`
- Unable to complete review due to dirty workspace:
  Roll status back to Ready For Impl before handoff.
  `kno update <id> --status ready_for_implementation`
  `--add-note "<dirty workspace details>"`
  `kno update <id> --add-handoff-capsule "<dirty workspace handoff>"`
