# /ship-release

Ship a new Knots release.

## Use this skill when

- The user asks to cut, ship, publish, or verify a new Knots release.
- The user wants help with the Changesets-driven version PR and release flow.
- The user needs recovery help when a version bump merged but the GitHub
  release or assets did not publish.

## Steps

1. **Confirm release state on `main`** — Work from a clean `main` branch and
   pull the latest remote state first. Check the current version in
   `Cargo.toml` and `package.json`, then compare it with the latest semver
   tag and the GitHub release for `v<version>`.
   Preview commits since the latest semver tag with:
   `git log "$(git tag --sort=-version:refname | head -n 1)"..HEAD --oneline`

2. **Inspect pending release inputs** — Check whether there are unreleased
   changesets in `.changeset/` and whether a `Version Packages` PR already
   exists or was recently merged. For local version consistency, run:
   `npm run check-cargo-version`

3. **Audit changeset coverage** — Walk every commit since the last tag
   (`git log "$(git tag --sort=-version:refname | head -n 1)"..HEAD --oneline`)
   and classify each one:
   - **User-facing** (CLI flags, commands, output format, defaults, errors,
     config, deprecations, bug fixes users would notice) → must be covered by
     a changeset in `.changeset/` or be folded into an existing changeset's
     body.
   - **Internal-only** (refactors, test-only changes, CI, docs, comments, dep
     bumps with no behavior change) → no changeset required.

   If any user-facing commit lacks a changeset, **stop and surface the gap to
   the user before proceeding**. Offer to author the missing changesets,
   commit+push them, and let the Changesets workflow refresh the Version
   Packages PR. Do not ship a release that silently omits user-facing changes
   from the changelog. Re-run this audit against the refreshed PR before
   continuing to step 4.

4. **Decide the path** —
   - If user-facing changes are on `main` and no version PR exists yet, let the
     Changesets workflow create or update the `Version Packages` PR.
   - If the `Version Packages` PR exists, review the bump, changelog, and
     version sync before merging it.
   - If the version PR is already merged and a GitHub release already exists
     for `v<version>`, treat it as already shipped and verify assets instead of
     calling it a tag collision.
   - If the version PR is already merged and the GitHub release is missing or
     incomplete, move to release verification or recovery.

5. **Run required quality gates** — Before merging a version PR or retrying a
   release, run:
   - `make sanity`
   - `npm run check-cargo-version`

   If release tooling changed, also run:
   - `scripts/release/smoke-install.sh`

   Stop on any failure. Do not ship a release with failing sanity checks.

6. **Trigger or watch the release** —
   - Normal path: merge the `Version Packages` PR into `main`. The `Release`
     GitHub Actions workflow should trigger automatically on the push.
   - Recovery path: if the version bump is already on `main` but the release is
     missing or incomplete, inspect the `Release` workflow and re-run it or
     trigger it with `workflow_dispatch`.

7. **Verify published outputs** — Confirm the GitHub Release exists for
   `v<version>` and that these assets are attached:
   - `knots-v<semver>-darwin-arm64.tar.gz`
   - `knots-v<semver>-linux-x86_64.tar.gz`
   - `knots-v<semver>-linux-aarch64.tar.gz`
   - `knots-v<semver>-checksums.txt`

8. **Report** — Tell the user the released version, whether the release was
   newly published or recovered, link the GitHub Release, and call out any
   follow-up work if verification found a problem.

## Notes

- Knots uses Changesets to open a `Version Packages` PR; the release is not cut
  by manually bumping a `patch`, `minor`, or `major` flag in this repo.
- `npm run version-packages` runs `changeset version` and then syncs
  `Cargo.toml` and `package.json`.
- The release workflow publishes GitHub release notes with `--generate-notes`.
- An existing `v<version>` tag is normal after a successful release. Treat only
  `tag exists but release is missing` or `release exists but required assets are
  missing` as recovery conditions.
